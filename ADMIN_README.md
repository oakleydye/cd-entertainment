# Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for managing contact form submissions and site settings.

## Access

The admin dashboard can be accessed at `/admin`. A small, discrete link is available in the footer (represented by a "â€¢" after the copyright text).

## Login

## Database Schema

### Contact Form Submissions
```sql
contact_form_submissions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  phone_number VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  event_type_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  date_of_event DATE NOT NULL,
  venue_location VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  event_description TEXT NOT NULL,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

### App Settings
```sql
app_settings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  accepting_song_requests BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
)
```

### Song Requests
```sql
song_requests (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  artist_names VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  url VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  image_url VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  request_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_archived BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Protection**: Change the default password in production
2. **Environment Variables**: Store admin credentials securely
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for admin endpoints
4. **HTTPS**: Ensure admin access is only over HTTPS in production
5. **Session Management**: Consider implementing proper session management with expiration

## Usage Tips

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Regularly archive or delete old submissions to keep the dashboard manageable
2. **Contact Management**: Use the email/phone links to quickly respond to inquiries
3. **Song Request Monitoring**: Monitor song requests to understand music preferences
4. **Settings Management**: Toggle song requests based on current capacity or events

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-user authentication with role-based access
- Email integration for responding directly from the dashboard
- Export functionality for submissions
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Analytics and reporting features
- Bulk operations for managing multiple items
